Why does it always have to be 'your mother' that's the clueless person you're explaining things to? Why not your father or other male relative? OK, this doesn't work in my family - my father does a certain amount of computer programming stuff - but as a general principle...

Anyway, the command line is like an old school version of Siri - it's where you ask the computer to do things or ask it for information, but using very structured dialogue rather than more natural language.

cd is change directory - followed by the name of the folder - means go to that folder/directory location and do the next commands from that place
mkdir is make a directory - creates a folder
mv means rename rather than remove, this is because changing a file or directory folder is moving the data to a location with a different name
rm is remove and deletes the file
rm -r will delete a folder and its contents
touch creates a new file
ls is list, and asks the computer to list the contents of the folder
find will search for the file
cp is copy
exit will close the terminal window
